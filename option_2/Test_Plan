Test Plan:
1. Introduction

  1.1 Purpose:
    The purpose of this test plan is to outline the testing strategy and approach 
    for the newly added features of the website: https://docs.cypress.io/.

  1.2 Scope:
    This test plan covers E2E testing of the website: https://docs.cypress.io/.
    The testing will include both manual and automated tests.

2. Test Items
  Site search bar
  Side menu "Dashboard" category and subcategories
  New language support - Spanish

3. Features to be Tested
  Search bar functionality
  Search bar navigation
  Dashboard view and correct information display
  Interaction between subcategories
  Correct display of metrics
  Correct translation into Spanish
  Navigation between languages
  Completion of translation

4. Features Not to be Tested
  API integrations
  Integration with external software

5. Approach
  
  5.1 Testing Levels:
    E2E Testing: Simulation of real user scenarios, verification of website workflows. 
      Testing will include user interaction with the Dashboard and Subcategories, 
      navigation, data display, and translation.

    Integration Teting: Testing the correct cooperation between Dashboard, 
      Subcategories, and other categories of the website. Verifying correct display
      according to the search bar input. Ensuring translation is consistent across the entire website.

    Regression Testing: Retesting already tested functionalities after implementing 
      new changes to ensure no regression has occurred. 

  5.2 Testing Types:
    Functional Testing: Verify each feature against requirements.
    Non-functional Testing: Verify each feature is accessible and performs well.

  5.3 Test Design Techniques:
    Black-box testing for accessibility of features.
    Automation testing using Cypress for regression and integration verification.

6. Item Pass/Fail Criteria
  All automated test cases must pass without critical defects.
  No high-severity bugs should remain unresolved.

7. Suspension Criteria and Resumption Requirements
  Automated testing will not be suspended if critical bugs are found.
  Manual testing will be suspended if critical bugs are found.
  Manual testing will resume once the critical bugs are fixed and verified.

8. Test Deliverables
